Hello! How can I help you today?</s>

*** write an hello world in elixir lang

Sure! Here's an example of how you might write "Hello, world" in Elixir:
#+begin_src
IO.write("Hello, world")
#+end_src
You can also use the =IO.puts/1= function, which is similar to =IO.write/1=, but adds a newline at the end:
#+begin_src
IO.puts("Hello, world")
#+end_src
I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</s>

*** write a valid org-babel block with hello world in elixir

Certainly! Here's an example of a valid Org-Babel block that includes the code to print "Hello, world" in Elixir:
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
IO.write("Hello, world")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [A[Jiex(5)> import_file("/tmp/babel-XklLCS/elixir-JlmYDY")
: Hello, world:ok
: [A[Jiex(6)>

You can also use the =IO.puts/1= function, which is similar to =IO.write/1=, but adds a newline at the end:
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
IO.puts("Hello, world")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [A[Jiex(7)> import_file("/tmp/babel-XklLCS/elixir-BOta8w")
: Hello, world
: :ok
: [A[Jiex(8)>

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
